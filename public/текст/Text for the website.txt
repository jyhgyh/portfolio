About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a front-end developer who loves turning ideas into clean, user-friendly, and beautiful websites.
I work with Angular, React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and when it comes to styling and aesthetics, Tailwind CSS is my go-to. From time to time, I also dive into the backend â€” using Spring Boot or Node.js â€” to better understand the full picture of a project.

Iâ€™m currently studying at Web@cademie (Epitech, France) and constantly improving my skills through different projects: from a mental health support platform (MindCare) to my portfolio website (One Life â€“ One Page) and even an RPG game.

What I enjoy the most is combining design with code, paying attention to details, and making sure that everything feels simple and pleasant for the user. Beyond web development, I also work with Photoshop and Illustrator, enjoy exploring logic and processes, and love discovering new fields.

For me, coding isnâ€™t just about writing code â€” itâ€™s about creating projects that truly work for people. ðŸš€
